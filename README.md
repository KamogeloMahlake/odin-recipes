# odin-recipes

This is my first html project. I have previous coding experience as i have coded in python and I have a very basic understanding of C. 

This project is about creating an pages that contain recipes that link back to the index page. The skills I used doing this project are the html boilerplate, how to create ordered and unordered lists, how to add images, how to link create relative links and how to create proper headings.
